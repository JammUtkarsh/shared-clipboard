# Shared Clipboard

This is a simple app which let you share clips/texts between computers in command line interface.

It is based on a client server model. Where in we have common server which manages the user authentication,
and syncing the clips across devices.

_I came across this problem when I was setting up my personal server, and I could not ssh in it.
I had to manually check in my laptop and then type it there on the server. With Shared Clipboard, you will be able to
transfer clips across devices without using ssh._

PS: It is still in development. 💫️
